Reading and Writing files
=========================

In this workshop we will learn how to get data in and out of Python using solely built-in Python functions and types, and we will then move on to see how we can use modules such as `asciitable <https://github.com/taldcroft/asciitable>`_ and `ATpy <http://atpy.github.com>`_ to read tables of data in various formats.
