Enthought Python Distribution (EPD)
-----------------------------------

First download the appropriate Mac OSX EPD installer from `this <http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/contrib/python4astronomers>`_ page.
The user name and password were emailed to the pythonusers mailing list.

.. note:: If you are using MacOS X 10.5 or 10.6 on an Intel Mac, we 
          recommend that you install EPD 7.0.2 64-bit
          (``epd-7.0-2-macosx-x86_64.dmg``). If you are using a PPC or
          Intel Mac with MacOS X 10.4, you will need to download an older
          32-bit version (``epd_py25-4.2.30201-macosx-u.dmg``).

After downloading the disk image, open it, then double-click on
``EPD.mpkg`` and follow the prompts to install. Choose all the defaults for
installing (in particular use the default installation location).

Optionally, you can go over to the `Getting Started with EPD
<http://www.enthought.com/products/epdgetstart.php?platform=mac>`_ page.

MacOS X Developer Tools
-----------------------

Before you install additional packages, you will need to make sure that you
have installed the MacOS X Developer Tools (XCode) so that the ``gcc``
compiler is available. If you are not sure if you have the developer tools
installed, try typing ``gcc`` in a Terminal. You should see something like this::

    $ gcc
    i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1: no input files

If you get ``gcc: command not found`` then you need to install the
developer tools. If you already have the developer tools installed, you can
proceed to the next section.

There are several ways to install XCode:

* The developer tools should be present on one of the installation DVDs
  that came with your Mac. Often, this can be found on DVD 2 rather than on
  the main DVD.

* You can `register <http://developer.apple.com/programs/register/>`_ for
  free as an Apple Developer, which will give you access to XCode 3.

* If you like to live on the bleeding edge, have MacOS X 10.6.6, and don't
  mind shelling out $4.99, go to the App Store (``/Applications/App
  Store.app``) and buy XCode 4. Note that while this should work, we have
  not tested it so we can't guarantee that everything will go smoothly with
  the Enthought Python Distribution.

Fortran (Optional)
------------------

You may at some point come across packages which require a Fortran
compiler, or you may want to interface Fortran and Python code. If not, you
can proceed to the next section.

The prefered compiler to interface Fortran and Python code is ``gfortran``.
Other compilers `should` work, but if you want to be on the safe side, you
can download a one-click installer for gfortran 4.2.3 from `this page
<http://r.research.att.com/tools/>`_. Once you have installed it, make sure
that typing ``gfortran`` gives something like this::

    $ gfortran
    i686-apple-darwin8-gfortran-4.2: no input files

If you get ``gfortran: command not found``, then ``gfortran`` did not
install correctly.

Additional Packages
-------------------

Next open a terminal window and do the following::

  easy_install asciitable
  easy_install http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits/pyfits-2.4.0.tar.gz
  easy_install http://stsdas.stsci.edu/astrolib/pywcs-1.9-4.4.4.tar.gz
  easy_install atpy
  easy_install aplpy
  easy_install http://stsdas.stsci.edu/astrolib/vo-0.6.tar.gz
  easy_install http://stsdas.stsci.edu/astrolib/coords-0.37.tar.gz
  easy_install pyparsing
  easy_install pyregion

Now go back to the :ref:`installation_test` section to verify everything is working.
