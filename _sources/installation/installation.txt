Installing Python
=================

Installing the Python language itself on most platforms is generally very easy.
However, installing the other core packages that you will need in day to day
work can be more of a challenge.  

The details depend on several factors:

- Machine platform (MacOS, Linux, Windows)
- Privileges (root or non-root)
- Detailed flavor of OS (RHEL / CentOS, Ubuntu, etc)
