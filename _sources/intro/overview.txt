Overview
==========

The CfA Python Lunch group [#]_ is hosting a series of hands-on workshops to explore
the Python language and the powerful analysis tools it provides. *The emphasis
is on using Python to solve real-world problems that
astronomers are likely to encounter in research.*

- The workshops will immediately make use of the full suite of plotting,
  analysis, and file reading tools.
- Along the way elements of the Python language such as control structures,
  functions, and objects will be introduced as needed.

Hands-on
-----------------

- This will be a hands-on experience largely focused on interactive data analysis
  using tutorial examples that you type or cut-n-paste into the Python
  interpreter.
- Participants should bring a laptop to each session or partner-up with someone who 
  has a laptop.

.. important::

  The first hands-on session on April 1 will be devoted to building a working Python
  environment that will be used for subsequent sessions.  **This is critical.**  To 
  follow the tutorials your environment must satisfy these :ref:`python_requirements`.

Agenda for today
----------------

- Why should you use Python?
- Quick tour of analysis with Python
- Who is using Python
- Where to learn more (tutorials, books, resources)
- Workshop logistics
