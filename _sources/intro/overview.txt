Overview
========

The CfA Python Lunch group is hosting a series of hands-on workshops to explore
the Python language and the powerful analysis tools it provides. The emphasis
is first and foremost on using Python to solve real-world problems that
astronomers are likely to encounter in research. The workshops will immediately
make use of the full suite of plotting, analysis, and file reading tools. Along
the way elements of the Python language such as control structures, functions,
and objects will be introduced as needed. All levels of experience are welcome,
but we will assume basic familiarity with Linux/MacOS and some exposure to a
data analysis environment like IDL, Matlab or supermongo.

This will be a hands-on experience largely focused on interactive data
analysis. After the first introductory talk on March 11, participants should
bring a laptop to each session or partner-up with someone who has a laptop. The
first hands-on session on April 1 will be devoted to building a working Python
environment that will be used for subsequent sessions. After that we'll dive
right in with tutorial examples that you type or cut-n-paste into the Python
interpreter.

Introduction to the lunchers
----------------------------

- Started in 2009 (?) as a lunchtime gathering of Pythonistas
- Created CfA pythonusers email list in May 2009
- Started hosting the occasional formal presentation
- Community-wide email in Jan 2010
- Lots of initial interest followed by a return to a core group of about 10
- Typically 4 to 8 people meeting in the HEAD lounge.

Agenda for today
----------------

- Why should you use Python?
- Major packages available for analysis and research
- Quick tour of cool things you can do in Python
- Discussion of workshop schedule and location
