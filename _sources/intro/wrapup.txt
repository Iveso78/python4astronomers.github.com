Logistics and open discussion
=============================

Workshop schedule and location
------------------------------

Currently we have the A-building classroom booked from 1:30pm to 3pm for five
Friday afternoons in April and May.  The goal will be to finish by 2:30pm.

On April 1 there is a
Graduate lunch scheduled 1pm - 2:30pm (does anybody know why the unusual time?).

- The classroom can hold about 30 people.  How many plan to attend?

Agenda
--------

All workshops will be in Phillips Auditorium.  Please note the times below, which
jump around a bit due to availability of Phillips.

Workshop materials
------------------

All the workshop materials will be available through the web site:

 `<http://python4astronomers.github.com>`_

- Presentations
- Tutorial and example scripts
- Example data files

The workshop presentations are being developed and each one will be ready by the
morning of that session (and hopefully earlier).  You are encouraged to download the
tutorial and data prior to the session starting.

Installing Python and the rest
------------------------------

In order to follow along the tutorial sessions you need to have Python 2.6 or 2.7
installed and satisfy these :ref:`python_requirements`.  At least a week before
the April 1 session (Building a scientific Python installation) we will send
out materials with specific instructions for:

- HEAD managed linux (CentOS 5) machines (via xterm on laptop)
- CF managed linux (CentOS 5) machines (via xterm on laptop)
- MacOSX 10.5 and MacOSX 10.6
- Self-managed linux with root (recent Ubuntu, others?)

At the very least you should download the necessary package files for your
configuration in advance of the April 1 session.  

Open discussion
---------------

What experience do people have with Python:

- None / basic (setting variables, using Python-based analysis tools)
- Intermediate (functions, control structures)
- Advanced (classes, modules)

A :ref:`comparison_sm_idl` is available.

**Questions?**
