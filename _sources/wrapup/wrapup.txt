What were the good points and what could be improved?


Achieving Python Zen
------------------------

Boot camp is complete, now the journey begins ... and somewhere along the way
you'll find that Python feels like an old friend.

*Accept the hardships ahead:*

- "Ugh, I could do this so much faster the old way."
- "Stupid Python, why isn't this working?!"
- "These plots look ugly."

*Ask for help and give it*

- Use the ``pythonusers`` mailing list when you get stuck (though it doesn't hurt to google your question first)
- **Respond** to ``pythonusers`` if you might know the answer or have an idea

*Talk about your Python projects*

- The Python lunch is a great forum to share what you've done and get feedback on ways to improve.  
- The best contributions are often from beginners!


Future: Python Lunch and seminars
-----------------------------------

- Continue the informal lunch on Tuesday (maybe every other week over the summer).
- Solicit volunteers to talk about their projects and show code.
- Once a month seminars to cover different topics within a 1-hour time slot (some may require multiple parts):

  - Embedding C / C++ / Fortran in Python
  - Making a GUI tool
  - Making a Python-backed web site
  - Classes and object oriented programming
  - Writing modules or packages for re-usable code
  - Machine learning (clustering, categorization)
  - Database access
  - 

Please send any other ideas to ``pythonusers``.
